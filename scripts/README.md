Even it might seem unpracticle and chaotic,
I decided to stay on a "one file per function implementation"
gollum hide these and provide human typable access
if there's something to change, still only need to update one place
and make function call than a file than a cenntral file, who
would have to receive some form of arguments to know what to execute

maybe writting a paragraph to explain the choice should be enough to call it a bad one...





naaaannhhh....
