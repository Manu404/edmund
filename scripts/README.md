Even it might seem unpracticle and chaotic, I decided to stay on a "one file per function implementation"

Gollum hide these and provide human typable access
If there's something to change, still only need to update one place

And make a single function means calling a file which is simpler and more flexible than a central file, which would have to receive some form of arguments to know what to execute

maybe writting a paragraph to explain the choice should be enough to call it a bad one...





naaaannhhh....
