- WSL used first
- then wsl got updated to 2
- then a ubuntu runnning i3 and few tools got used
- then ubuntu started to ubuntued too much
- then clean debian with nothing appeared, and it was good.

So these scripts are meant to get me up and ready from a clean install without xorg/wm.

I'm using i3 and think will stay on it, wish I tried it few years

it also install snapy snap snappy-d from bubuntu, cause I'll need few yummmy software like vscode and firefox (there was no netscape :/), 
so, in a way, let's accept snapd have them not touching everything everywhere too much.

TODO: There's a cmake\* package installed through snap that will need to be migrated to a normal install
